#' Alterations

#' Alterations made to the data collected from Stella Maris include:
#'  -	Only taking measurements from 2021-11-21 0:00 to 2021-11-24 23:30 (local time).
#'  -	Taking the average of all measurements within the half-hour.
#'  -	Rounding all the measurements to two decimal places.
#' Alterations made to the data collected from the COVE weather station include:
#'  -	Only taking measurements taken at the hour and half-hour.
#'  -	When measurements were not found for the above, an average was taken from the two nearest times and put as an estimate for the true value.
